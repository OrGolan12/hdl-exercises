# hdl-exercises
HDL exercises and reference solutions for learning and teaching digital hardware design. Topics include combinational, sequential, and clocking circuits.

## Combinational Logic
- [`comparator_2bit/`](comparator_2bit) — 2-bit comparator

## Sequential Logic
- [`counter/`](counter) — simple counter design  
- [`pos_edge_detection/`](pos_edge_detection) — positive edge detector
